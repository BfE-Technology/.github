# How to contribute

First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute to BfE's .github. It is people like you that make it possible for BfE's .github to be such a great resource for everyone and enable Bridges for Enterprise (BfE) to better serve the community.

This document outlines the various ways in which you can contribute to BfE's .github and the wider BfE community.

## Code of Conduct

This project, along with other BfE projects and the BfE community, is governed by the [BfE Code of Conduct](https://github.com/BfE-Technology/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project, you are expected to uphold this code of conduct. Please report any code of conduct violations to opensource@bridgesforenterprise.com.

## Creating Issues

**Please do not open a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability**. Instead, refer to our [security policy](https://github.com/BfE-Technology/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md) on responsible disclosure of security issues.

Before creating a bug report or feature request, please check the [issues list](../../issues) to see if the same issue has been reported before. If there is one, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one. Otherwise, please [create a new one](../../issues/new/choose) and provide as much information as possible.

## Submitting a patch/pull request

We warmly welcome contributions from you! Feel free to fork the repository, make changes and submit a pull request for our maintainers to review. However, before submitting a pull request, please ensure that:

1. You are working on the latest version of the project on the main branch.
2. You have checked existing open or recently merged pull requests to make sure that the problem you are trying to resolve hasn’t been addressed yet.
3. You create a new issue first, if you intend to make significant changes, so that we can discuss them. This allows us to avoid wasting your time and effort in the work you do.

Here’s the pull request workflow that we follow:

1. Fork the repository by clicking on the “Fork” button at the top.
2. Make changes to your local copy of the repository and push them to your fork.
3. Once ready, send us a pull request. Our team will review it at the earliest opportunity.

## Any other questions

If you have any questions, feel free to post a question in the [Discussions](../../discussions) under the Q&A category, or send us an email at opensource@bridgesforenterprise.com.
